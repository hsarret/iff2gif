###### Convert IFF ILBM/ANIM files to GIF files

ILBM and ANIM were very popular formats on the Amiga. ILBM also saw some limited use on other platforms in
the early '90s, while ANIM never really made its way off of the Amiga. This program will convert them both to GIF,
which has more widespread support across several platforms.

Usage: iff2gif <input file> [output file]

The output file name is optional. If not provided, it will be generated by attaching a .gif extension to the input file name.

Deep ILBM files are not supported, as using true color with GIF is not exactly supported in any sort of standard way. Files
using HAM modes will be converted, but without any of the HAMming effect that makes them interesting to use on the Amiga.

For animations, iff2gif tries to minimize the amount of data per frame. The first frame is stored in its entirety. Succesive
frames only store the rectangular regions that contain actual changes. Within that region, unchanged pixels may either be
stored as-is or substituted with a transparent color, depending on which iff2gif decides results in smaller image data.
