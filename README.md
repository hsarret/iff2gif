# iff2gif
#### Convert IFF ILBM/ANIM files to GIF files

ILBM and ANIM were very popular formats on the Amiga. ILBM also saw some limited use on other platforms in
the early '90s, while ANIM never really made its way off of the Amiga. This program will convert them both to GIF,
which has more widespread support across several platforms.

For animations, iff2gif tries to minimize the amount of data per frame. The first frame is stored in its entirety. Succesive
frames only store the rectangular regions that contain actual changes. Within that region, unchanged pixels may either be
stored as-is or substituted with a transparent color, depending on which iff2gif decides results in smaller image data.


Usage: iff2gif [*options*] *input file* [*output file*]

The output file name is optional. If not provided, it will be generated by attaching a .gif extension to the input file name.

### Options

* **-f**  
  Write each frame to a separate file. If the output file name has a series of 0s
  at the end before the file extension, they will be replaced by the frame
  number. This will dynamically expand if the field width isn't large
  enough for the frame number. Note that 0s embedded in the middle of the filename will
  not be replaced with the frame number. They must be at the end of the filename.
    
  If there are no 0s to replace, then the frame number is inserted before the extension. In this case,
  if the input file contains a DPAN chunk, the frame count stored in it will be used to decide how many
  0s to pad with.
    
  Examples with the -f option:
  - For the output file name "funtime-00.gif", frame 1 will be written to "funtime-01.gif".
    Frame 12 will be written to "funtime-12.gif". If there is a frame 1000, it
    will be written to "funtime-1000.gif"
  - For the output file name "hello.gif" and the input file has a DPAN chunk that
    indicates 156 frames, frame 1 will be written to "hello001.gif".
    Frame 10 will be written to "hello010.gif".
    Frame 100 will be written to "hello100.gif".
  - For the output filename "world.gif" and the input file has no DPAN chunk, frame 1
    will be written to "world1.gif". Frame 10 will be written to "world10.gif".
    Frame 100 will be written to "world100.gif". And so on.</dd>

* **-r *frame-rate***  
  Write the GIF with the specified frame rate instead of the one from the ANIM.

### Limitations
Deep ILBM files are not supported, as using true color with GIF is not exactly supported in any sort of standard way. Files
using HAM modes will be converted, but without any of the HAMming effect that makes them interesting to use on the Amiga.
